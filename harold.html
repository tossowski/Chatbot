            <p class = "pageText">Please chat with this agent until he says Goodbye. You can respond with as much detail as you like (or even skip a question by pressing the submit button with an empty textbox if you feel it is too personal). Please try to answer in complete sentences. Your responses will not be recorded. </br></br>
                When the conversation ends, you will be presented with a mystery number which you should use to fill out a survey that will be provided. You can start the conversation by asking the agent what its name is.</p>
